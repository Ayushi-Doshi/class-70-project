                    This new future includes a dream of collaboration with all aspects of community and industry, as we can only achieve a grand school when all stakeholders are actively engaged. In this same spirit, Amrit expects that it’s Alumni are the best poised to support this expansion and growth. Who better to talk about the work than the ones who have experienced it for themselves.
